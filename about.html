    <h1>Jessica Chen is a  graduating Linguistics and Digital Humanities student at UCLA, particularly interested in the intersection between language and technology.</h1>
    <p>
      Through curating this project and website, she was able to apply her analytical and creative skills as well as expand on her coding abilities in Python, HTML, and CSS. She would like to thank Dr. Nick Sabo for guiding her through this project. 
</p>
    <p>
      As an avid EDM listener, Jessica is intrigued about the complexities of the EDM soundscape and how perception plays a role in different musical interests. This led her to explore the phenomenon of EDM, specifically relating to the drops that keep her exhilarated, its connection to study BGM, and social media culture. By educating others about the genre, she hopes to remove the stigma that EDM is merely random sounds and represent it as something more. She believes that the EDM soundscape is simultaneously broad and unique, and that there is something for everyone.

    <h3> Cannon, J. W., & Greasley, A. E. (2021). Exploring relationships between electronic dance music event participation and well-being. Music & Science, 4, 2059204321997102. </h3>
    <p> 	This peer-reviewed source explores the relationship between EDM culture and psychological well-being, arguing that EDM allows for an opportunity of joy and unity, which increases positivity. As evidence, this source draws research from journals exploring EDM‚Äôs positive influence on people‚Äôs well-being and two conducted studies involving interviews and surveys. The information in this article is valuable to my research because it creates a correlation between engagement with EDM and well-being, which relates to my topic on the relationship between EDM and effective studying. I believe it has a lot of evidence and information that can be used to support my research argument because it aligns with the fact that because EDM increases psychological effects, people can study better. Although this source doesn‚Äôt specifically discuss studying, other sources combined with this one can be used to create such arguments.

    <h3> Goltz, F., & Sadakata, M. (2021). Do you listen to music while studying? A portrait of how people use music to optimize their cognitive performance.
</h3>
    <p> This peer-reviewed source explores the effects of background music (BGM) on cognitive task performance and argues that individuals tend to use BGM less when completing difficult cognitive tasks. As evidence, this source examines past research and studies to analyze the effects of BGM on focus and concentration, as well as uses a study with survey methods. This information is valuable to my research because it directly talks about the relationship between music and studying. As I explore EDM as BGM in studying, this information about BGM in general helps significantly. Although I agree with its argument that more people prefer calmer music for their studying BGM, I plan to try and go against that by also adding that EDM can be a helpful BGM. This source discusses the Cognitive Capacity Hypothesis and Arousal Mood Hypothesis, which I plan to explore more when arguing my thesis.

    <h3> Hau, K. T., Tee, V., & Kuan, G. (2024). Effects of Electronic Dance Music on Academic Performance among Medical Students: A Narrative Review. Education in Medicine Journal, 16(1). 
</h3>
<p> This peer-reviewed source from the Education in Medicine Journal explores EDM as a study music for medical students and argues that although there is not much research on this topic, electronic dance music can be associated with cognitive benefits for medical students and their test-taking results. As evidence, this source looks at databases in PubMed, ResearchGate, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar to find research on EDM as an academic performance enhancer. This source is significant to my research because it describes why EDM can be good for studying and memorizing. It speaks about the breakdowns and drops that occur in the subgenres of EDM and that the BPM and auditory experience relates to the Mozart Effect, which is a term I will introduce in my research. Overall, the information fits into my research because it talks about studies that show what EDM can do to one‚Äôs psychological state.

</h3>
<p> This peer-reviewed source explores the negative emotions of music and argues that emotions are concepts that society creates and therefore, negative emotions led by music are actually positive. As evidence, this source examines hypotheses and theories such as The Appraisal Theory of Emotion or The Basic-Emotions Hypothesis. The information in this source is essential to my research because it describes music as a source of intense emotion that we resonate with. However, I disagree on parts that argue EDM bass drops are unpleasant and hope to go against this argument by using the concept of emotion. In other words, there are pieces of information in this article that prove my argument about the idea that music is interactive and allows us to feel comfort, which I plan to utilize in my thesis.

<h3> Smith, J. (2024). Squelches, Wobbles and Risers: Continuous Processes and Subgenres in Electronic Dance Music. Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture, 16(1), 98-124. </h3>
<p> This peer-reviewed source explores the subgenres of EDM and argues that EDM uses a lot of continuous processes, which are essential to the distinction of its subgenres. As evidence, this source analyzes different EDM tracks, production guides, and fan discourse. The information in these analyzes is important to my research because it goes through the different and unique sounds used in EDM in-depth. It also offers a history of EDM and compares it to current EDM genres, noting the specific effects that go into six particular EDM subgenres. The idea behind continuous processes is especially valuable to my argument because it allows me to start analyzing what about the sounds are so captivating to people who listen to EDM and get to a certain point on what that sound specifically is. </p>

</h3>
<p> This source explores musical techniques that EDM DJs and producers commonly use to create a heightened experience while listening to their music. It specifically focuses on the infamous build-up and drops that appear in the songs to create an emotional response. By analyzing two EDM songs, ‚ÄúBody‚Äù by Cinnamon Chasers and ‚ÄúIcarus‚Äù by Madeon, the source argues that uplifters, the drum roll effect, frequency changes, and removal and reintroduction of the bass and bass drum help in creating the build-up and drop. This is significant to my research because it emphasizes that the drop is vital. I completely agree with this because it is the characteristic that separates it from other genres and no matter what genre of EDM we focus on, there will always be a drop. Additionally, it helps me in arguing that the build-up is essential in creating that uplifting and heightened sensation that comes before the drop.

  <p> This peer-reviewed source explores bass music, specifically dubstep, in the context of music festivals and social media and argues that the public consciousness of certain EDM culture, like bass face, keeps the consumption of that culture alive. As evidence, this source studies fieldwork of the widely-known EDM festival Lost Lands and examines interviews, focus group sessions, participant observation, and qualitative data elicitation. Additionally, it takes into account the experiences of dubstep listeners. This source is significant to my research because it explores the relationship between EDM culture and social media, which is a core aspect of my thesis. The point is to find connections between social media trends and electronic dance music, so I think this source is good at doing that, especially since it focuses on dubstep. This will help my argument because the information in this source can be combined with those from other sources to create a deeper analysis and understanding of the connection between EDM, studying, and social media. </p>

</h3>
<p> This peer-reviewed source explores a vital phenomenon in EDM referred to as the drop. It attempts to find what characteristics constitute a drop through segmentation of popular EDM songs and a content-based approach. As evidence, this source takes data from SoundCloud and analyzes the timed comments for information about a drop. Furthermore, it uses Python SDK to search for songs under dubstep, electro, and house. Not only does this source provide helpful information on research methods pertaining to EDM, but it also offers an introduction to what drops are and how they contribute to the music. This will help my thesis because it focuses on the main characteristic of the EDM genre.
