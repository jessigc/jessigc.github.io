 <p> While many people perceive EDM as loud, heavy, and therefore unsuitable as study background music (BGM), its soundscape can contribute to focus and concentration. Furthermore, one feature of EDM is that it encompasses a broad range of genres and subgenres, which means that there is something for everyone. The following visualization lays out important metadata elements of “STRANGERS” by ALLEYCVT, “Language” by Porter Robinson, and two additional tracks discussed under a transcription analysis. Python was used to gather the metadata for all four tracks and illustrates that each song’s genre category is a subgenre of a genre, further proving how vast but specific the EDM soundscape is.

 <p> According to Hau et al. (2024), the repeating rhythms in EDM tracks are easy to remember and therefore, the steadiness of the beat enhances academic performance among students by promoting cognitive activities. Furthermore, the pleasurable peak and drop experience “facilitate[s] positive mood shifts” that help listeners concentrate. Since EDM is often associated with music festivals and raves where people experience unity and joy, listening to the music causes them “to recall exciting and happy memories” that put them in a good mood and alleviate any feelings of stress and anxiety that may arise from their priorities as students. This argument mainly relies on perception because those that are accustomed to listening to EDM and adore it may experience more cognitive benefits compared to students who are unfamiliar with the type of structure and sounds that EDM possesses. Therefore, the importance of this argument is to eliminate the stigma that EDM is only loud and distracting, and appreciate that not only does it have a wide range of genres, but also its repetitive nature of electronic instrumental segments and melodies are suitable as study BGM because they are able to promote concentration. 
</p>

<p> Although it seems contradictory at first, listeners find comfort and leisure in energetic EDM rhythms, which enhances their well-being and productivity. Many students use BGM in the first place because it helps them concentrate as well as “mask other background noise in their environment,” which “keeps them awake [and] motivated” (Goltz & Sadakata 2021). Based on the high danceability and energy levels of EDM, its tracks can easily keep students awake and focused.

<p> In order to capture a deeper understanding of EDM’s ability to promote well-being and an immersive and electrifying auditory experience, this transcription analysis touches on “Riptide” by artist and DJ, Trivecta, and “Wherever You Are” by Dutch DJ and producer, Martin Garrix. <br> Both are lyrical tracks, however “Riptide” has melodic bass features while “Wherever You Are” encapsulates progressive house qualities.

<p> After using Whisper in Python to generate AI transcriptions of both songs, the Word Error Rate was calculated with the automatic transcription. “Riptide” received a Word Error Rate of 0.43, which is higher than that of “Wherever You Are,” which received a 0.15. This difference can be attributed to the distinct genres and demonstrates that all EDM songs exemplify similar structures, but at the same time, remain unique compared to one another.

<section class="ta-study2">
<p> As a melodic bass track, “Riptide” emphasizes the importance of lyrics and the manner of singing. The AI transcription has several errors in the way words are conveyed, such as mistaking “in’” for “ing” in the words“ fallin’,” “pullin’,” “rushin’,” “everythin’,” and “takin’.” It also makes mistakes relating to the singer’s accent. Every instance of “riptide” is transcribed as “rift tide,” causing a higher error rate.  Additionally, the emotion and intensity lies more in the singing rather than the instrumental sounds. The track encapsulates themes about love, specifically about how it can be confusing and beautiful at the same time. It guides the listener through an emotional and passionate journey, which is a feature of many melodic bass songs. By combining up-beat tempos with such heartfelt themes, melodic EDM can be used in the study space to induce “positive emotional states” that are “closely associated with concentration” (Hau et al. 2024). 
</p>
<p>“Wherever You Are” displays a lower Word Error Rate than “Riptide” because its errors are closely related to time errors, not lyrical ones. For instance, the AI transcription misses several repeating lines of “Wherever you are” and has difficulty with distinguishing between the lyrics and instrumental segments, which suggests that the layers of sound in the instrumental sections are just as complex as the singing parts. In other words, their intensity on a waveform is similar. Unlike “Riptide,” much of the emotion in this track lies in the instrumental sounds. Progressive house relies on intensity and instrumentation to bring about uplifting themes and that “energetic nature may enhance positive emotions and motivation” among students (Hau et al. 2024). 
 </p>
 <p> Both instrumental and lyrical elements play an important role in the creation of EDM tracks. EDM is often seen as a solely instrumental music genre, however melodic genres are also admired. Although instrumental music can portray stories in itself, many melodic EDM tracks have emotional tones that strengthen those stories and hope to uplift listeners, even though the lyrics and themes are sometimes deemed sad. Regardless, those upward movements achieved through the layering of instrumental sounds in most genres of EDM create a feeling of flying, an emotion more closely associated with concentration rather than fatigue (Solberg 2014).
