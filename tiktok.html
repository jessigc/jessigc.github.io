  <h1 class="sm-title"> How Internet Trends Shape EDM </h1>

  <h2 class="sm-cap"> Exploring #TikTok </h2>
</div>

<section class="intro-tt">
 <p> While the emergence of EDM dates back to the early 1970s, it started to become a global phenomenon in the early 2010s, simultaneously with the birth and popularization of social media and Internet culture. Naturally, the Internet became a place for DJs to promote new music and currently continues to reinforce conversations surrounding the EDM culture and soundscape. According to Spencer 2022, ‚Äúthe Internet changes what a music genre is in the twenty-first century.‚Äù The perception that people have about EDM is influenced by the content they see online, while the trends seen on social media reflect what the culture is. Simply put, online culture leaves a lasting impact on offline culture and offline culture leaves a lasting impact on online culture, in a coinciding manner. 
</p>
<p> When producing tracks, DJs take notes of the type of sounds and trends that the EDM community gears towards and integrate them into their personal style, which is especially true of drops in the dubstep and bass realm. The ‚Äúbass face‚Äù term originated on the Internet and is an expression ‚Äútriggered by the precise onset of the drop,‚Äù as listeners always expect the drop to eventually occur. This expression is a ‚Äúweb-based depiction‚Äù that reinforces itself through public values about EDM communicated online and offline. Namely, posts and memes related to bass face set expectations of what a drop should feel and sound like, therefore influencing EDM styles (Spencer 2022).

        In order to analyze 
        social media conversations
        revolving around EDM, data
        was scraped from popular
        hashtags and DJ accounts 
        on the well-known social 
        media platform, TikTok. 
        This attempts to gather 
        information about 
        TikTok video trends 
        utilizing the hashtags 
        #edm
        #edmtok
        #edmtiktok 
        as well as the most recent 
        100 videos from the 
        accounts of Subtronics, 
        Dom Dolla, Martin Garrix,
        and Ray Volpe.

        Using the cleaned data,
        a word cloud was created to 
        illustrate the top terms 
        used in the EDM space 
        on TikTok.

 <p> The visualization reflects how DJs market their music as well as trending genres and events. The popularity of ‚Äúdubstep,‚Äù ‚Äúhouse,‚Äù ‚Äúriddim,‚Äù and ‚Äútechno‚Äù lets DJs and producers understand what is trending and they choose to combine ‚Äúviral‚Äù songs with trending genres to create a track that resonates with themselves and their listeners. The term ‚Äúremix‚Äù suggests that it is common for DJs to remix different tracks and promote them online. Overall, the music and production of their sets are influenced by what is talked about in the virtual EDM space. Furthermore, online conversations about raves and festivals, such as ‚ÄúTomorrowland,‚Äù ‚ÄúForbidden Kingdom,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEDC, bring about expectations about these events, to which DJs and producers often attempt to align with. When memes and trending audios that circulate TikTok and the Internet appear in the original tracks of DJs, people go crazy, which relates back to bass face. According to Spencer (2022), many listeners experience being taken aback when artists play a familiar build-up, cut it, and drop it into another track. This illustrates that artists recognize a lot of what people enjoy based on TikTok and Internet trends. 
</p>
<p> Popular Bass DJ, Excision, describes that the intensity of the music has a big impact on its listeners. He understands that with dubstep, there is a lot of emotion and rage that can be released on the dance floor. This is essentially EDM culture and it all comes back to the concept of the drop. The drop has value because of how it is advertised online. Artists often post short-formed videos on social media platforms that depict a drop or two along with a clip of the crowd going crazy. This sells the experience and again, creates expectations for EDM tracks and culture that DJs align with. Essentially, the reaction to the drop and the music overall is what both influences and becomes the brand (Spencer 2022). But one of the most important and beautiful parts is that although they are influenced by online culture, artists always stay true to their own unique sounds and passion.

  <p> Using the same scraped data and Python, clusters of the themes were created. For each cluster, there are 2-3 sample captions that encapsulate that theme. A quote table was made to visualize captions on popular TikTok EDM videos üé∂ </p>
</section>

<section class="quote-cont">
<p>The themes revolve around energy, enjoyment, community, events, relatability, and culture. Artists often share their remixes, clips from their shows, or samples of their new music to market their work and show appreciation to their fans. This creates a tight knit community on TikTok that openly communicates about new tracks and insane production at raves/festivals, which reinforces the relatability and culture existing in the EDM community. This further demonstrates that online culture influences offline culture in the EDM space. In other words, social media is so powerful that it impacts even the soundscape of EDM.
