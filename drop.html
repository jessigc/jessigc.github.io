<!-- drop main narrative -->
 <section class="main-intro-drop">
 <p>In EDM, the drop is a distinguishing feature of its soundscape and offers a powerful experience for its listeners. This defining element is created and elevated through ambience, built-up tension, and bass sounds. Although every track with a drop offers a unique escapade and can be executed in a various number of ways, they all have similar structures. </p>
<p> This analysis touches on two tracks, <a href="#vid-and-aud">“STRANGERS” by American DJ and producer, ALLEYCVT,</a> and <a href="#vid-and-aud">“Language” by Porter Robinson.</a> As a dubstep and space bass song, “STRANGERS” encapsulates strong and heavy basslines ideal for “headbanging.” In dubstep, the vibrating bass matches the beat and people enjoy shaking their heads up and down to it in intense ways. Listeners go crazy at dubstep sets because the drops are considered “filthy” and cause “the bass face,”  a nauseated expression representing “viscous audiotactile qualities” that are desirable (Spencer 2022). As for the elements of  electro and progressive house genres encapsulated in tracks such as “Language,” they have an emphasis on build-up and melody, which creates a euphoric feel at the drop. The enchanting journey full of “intensifying features” is what DJs and producers use to “move the crowd” and trigger "pleasurable states such as euphoria and ecstasy” (Solberg 2014). Ultimately, both types of tracks evoke emotional and extraordinary experiences in unique ways.

  <div class="continue-intro-drop">
    <p>According to Solberg (2014), most EDM tracks can be split into sections known as the breakdown, build-up, peak, and drop. The texture of the tracks are manipulated with uplifters, dramatic frequency changes, and the “removal and reintroduction of the bass and bass drum” to create a dynamic and rhythmic structure. Naturally, the intensity of the build-up produces an expectation for a peak and a drop that will increase emotional tension. Solberg describes it as the “Reaction Response and Appraisal Response” setting in, meaning that the drop makes listeners feel grounded.</p>
  <p> Let’s take a look at the patterns demonstrated in “STRANGERS” and “Language.” The first set of breakdowns, build-ups, peaks, and drops were analyzed in each of the tracks. When using Python to find silence segments in the audio, both tracks only had silence at the end of the music, meaning that the volume was over -50 dB for the entirety of the songs. Because this failed to offer much information about sonic qualities, the tracks were then inputted into the audio software, Audacity, where the songs’ waveforms were analyzed. Segments were marked in the following sequence: breakdown, build-up, peak, drop, and breakdown, with additional significant elements noted.<br> The following video depicts the waveform and segments for "STRANGERS."

<div class="wave-analysis-1">
  <p> In “STRANGERS,” bass sounds are vital, especially for the drop. Given that the genre of the track is dubstep and space bass, this fits the narrative. The analysis starts at the breakdown (0:00), the segment that acts as a foundation for the whole track and is characterized by a steady beat. It involves the removal of bass sounds and several instrument layers, creating an ambient feel (Solberg 2014). Preceding the build-up is a quick transition out of the breakdown indicated by a sudden drop in the number of bass beats (0:51). This transition sets the tone for the four modulated bass sounds that eventually appear in the drop segment. The build-up consists of a gradual increase in the amplitude and intensity of the audio, which are produced by utilizing uplifters (0:53). Uplifters slowly lift the pitch to create sounds that move upward to a maximum energy potential that leads to the peak and the drop (Solberg 2014). </p>
  <p> Between the peak (1:17) and the start of the drop (1:22), the waves become thinner, indicating the removal of the bass and bass drum, then the bass is reintroduced at the heavy drop. As the bass drum demonstrates a consistent pulse at each beat, illuminated by the apparent and steady tall waves, the “mini” elements appear multiple times. Although the term “mini” does not appear in EDM discourse, this research defines it as a quieter segment in the main drop that represents a “mini drop.” In other words, it is a shorter chunk that has the same characteristics of thinner wavelines before the main drop. There are four mini segments, with four modulated bass sounds in each one. Those bass sounds control the rhythm of the full drop segment. Mini 1 (1:25) and 2 (1:29) involve two thin beats before their four heavy bass beats, while Mini 3 and 4 have longer segments. Mini 3 (1:32) has an interesting pre-mini drop sound, as it is a synthesized euphoric pulsing beat effect. Lastly, Mini 4 (1:39) has 3 quick beats before the main heavy bass beats begin again. After the drop segment, the breakdown is revealed through the switch from thicker to thinner waves (1:46). The waves are closer together and display a weaker intensity. 
</p>
<p> Although this arrangement is complex, the entirety of the track has the same rhythmic pattern. The steadiness is easily perceived outside of the drop segment, however since the heavy synthesized bass sounds are the main event in the drop, listeners perceive the rhythm as slower. This highlights the importance of bass sounds in the dubstep genre.

<div class="wave-analysis-2">
  <p> The video above illustrates the waveform and segments for “Language.” This track relies heavily on gradual build-up through uplifters. The electric melodic sounds and progressiveness that are prominent in this track give it its genre name, electro and progressive house. House is known for steady rhythm and grooves that offer a cozy, upbeat, and happy atmosphere (Hau et al. 2024). Although dubstep also has a steady rhythm, the lack of extremely heavy bass sounds in house music allow listeners to perceive the steadiness more clearly. 
</p>
<p> This track has an interesting breakdown because it starts with a fixed drum rhythm then transitions into a euphoric and ambient feel. Due to this feature, the breakdown can be denoted as starting at the beginning of the song (0:00) or after the apparent drum rhythm (0:30). This calm segment is illustrated through thick and short waves and transitions to the build-up with a sudden increase in intensity. Unlike the pre-build-up transition in “STRANGERS,” there is a clear difference of amplitude and the distance between the waves in the transition for“Language” (0:58). In other words, the transition feels slower, creating a dramatic anticipation for the build-up. This musical expectancy builds a foundation for the tension and emotional peaks that arise in progressive house (Solberg 2014). The strong melody has a gradual increase in the height of waves and therefore intensity, which becomes even more powerful every five modulated bass beats. The drop is electrifying because the uplifting build-up segment is long. Ultimately, “Language” has a lengthy build-up (1:00) but shorter distance between the peak and the drop, while “STRANGERS” has a short build-up but longer distance between the peak and drop. This illustrates the unique varieties of EDM structure, specifically in dubstep and bass vs. electro/progressive house. 
</p>
<p> The amplitude of the waves decrease after the "switch” point (1:30) before the peak (1:59) and drop (2:00), which indicates an added element meant to surprise listeners in the midst of uplifters and prepare them for the drop. The waveform at the drop demonstrates a clear continuous rhythm and bassline, as the bass drum reveals a consistent pulse at every beat. A “mini” is marked at points that are perceived to be breaking the apparent rhythm. There are three big drops in the main drop segment and a “mini” between each one. Because the change in intensity is more dramatic in comparison to the “mini,” they are considered big drops. Each mini segment has 4 beats in them. Mini 1 (2:12) has two drums per beat, which totals to 8 drums, and precedes Drop 2 (2:15). Mini 2 (2:27) displays a clear bass rhythm and a set of synthesized sounds that gradually increase in amplitude, which act as the mini build-up before Drop 3 (2:30).
</p>

<p> Similar to “STRANGERS,” the entirety of “Language” has the same rhythmic pattern, however the changes in the sounds used in each mini as time progresses towards the next breakdown create that strong, emotional perception. When the drop segment ends and the track meets the breakdown (2:53), the waves become shorter, displaying a weaker amplitude and calmer atmosphere, which is a pattern that has roots in house music.

      The drop contributes to the danceable and energetic experience of EDM. First, danceability is associated with how easily a listener can dance and jump around to the music. Second, energy relates to how much a song can awaken a listener and offer them a heightened experience. In the following visualization, the leveled bars in danceability and energy highlight the idea that although some genres have popularized and evolved over the years, high danceability and energy remain at the core of all EDM tracks. In other words, EDM stays true to its roots by utilizing the drop as a characterizing element to promote an elevated experience full of danceability and energy. Without surprise, EDM festivals “provide opportunities for escapism that foster a sense of belonging” and allow listeners to express themselves freely, which stimulates well-being (Cannon & Greasley 2021).
